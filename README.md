  ## Description
  The Fitness-Tracker app tracks daily exercise. My focus for this project was developing the back-end code. I seperated code by concern. I wrote the html routes, the api routes, the server.js file, the models, and the controller. The code was written in javascript, using the libraries express and mongoose.
